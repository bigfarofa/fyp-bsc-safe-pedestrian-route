# Generating Safe Routes for Pedestrians: Avoiding Crime and Unsafe Roads
Report of my final year project written in 2022 for my BSc. in Computer Science. It's just for archival purposes.

This article present aims to provide methods for plan-
ning a safe route for pedestrians. This was
achieved by creating a cost algorithm that takes
in consideration crime density on streets, and
road data provided by OpenStreetMaps. The
algorithm effectively creates different and safer
routes than popular navigations software such as
Google Maps where it only focus on the fastest
route. To prove the usability of the algorithm,
an interactive Web Application was also created.
